Expense Tracker System – Python Mini Project

Project Description
The Expense Tracker System is a menu-driven console application written in Python.
The main purpose of this project is to help users record, view, and manage their daily expenses in a simple and organized manner.
The program allows the user to:
•Enter expense details such as date, category, and amount
•View all saved expense records
•Search expenses based on category
•Save the expense data into a file for future use

Features
The following features are implemented in this project:
•Add Expense: Allows the user to enter a new expense with date, category, and amount.
•View Expenses: Displays all the expenses entered during the program execution in a readable format.
•Search Expense by Category: Helps the user find expenses related to a specific category such as FOOD, TRAVEL, etc.
•Save and Exit: Saves all expense records to a text file and safely exits the program.

Concepts Used
This project uses the core Python concepts taught in class, which are listed below with brief explanations:
•Lists:
Used to store multiple expense records.
•Dictionaries:
Used to store individual expense details like date, category, and amount.
•Functions:
Used to divide the program into smaller, manageable blocks for better readability and reuse.
•Conditional Statements: Used to handle menu choices and decision-making logic.
•Loops:
A while loop is used to repeatedly display the menu until the user chooses to exit.
•String Methods: Methods like strip() and upper() are used to clean and standardize user input.
•Exception Handling: try and except blocks are used to handle invalid inputs, especially numeric values.
•File Handling: Used to store expense data permanently in a text file.
Data Storage Design
The application uses a list of dictionaries for data storage.
•The list stores multiple expense records.
•Each dictionary represents one expense record.
Example Expense Record:
{"Date": "01-01-2026", "Category": "FOOD", "Amount": 250}

 File Handling
The project uses file handling to save expense data permanently.
•File name used: expenses.txt
•The file is created automatically when the user selects Save & Exit from the menu.
•Each expense is saved as a separate line in the file.
This ensures that the data is not lost after the program ends.

Menu Options
The program displays the following menu options:
1.Add Expense
2.View Expenses
3.Search Expense by Category
4.Save & Exit
The menu continues to appear until the user chooses the exit option.

Input Guidelines
To ensure correct execution, the user should follow these input rules:
•Date should be entered in DD-MM-YYYY format.
•Category should be entered as text (for example: FOOD, TRAVEL).
•Amount should be entered as a numeric value.
Invalid numeric inputs are handled using exception handling.

Output
•The expense details are displayed clearly on the console.
•Saved records can be viewed later in the expenses.txt file.
